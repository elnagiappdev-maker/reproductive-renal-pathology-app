      "explanation_correct": "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease) is characterized by episodic gross hematuria following mucosal infections (synpharyngitic hematuria). Mesangial IgA deposits on immunofluorescence are diagnostic. It's the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide and can progress to chronic renal failure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "PSGN occurs 1-3 weeks after infection (not 1-2 days). Alport syndrome shows GBM splitting and hearing loss. Thin basement membrane disease is benign with isolated hematuria. HSP has similar pathology but presents with systemic vasculitis (purpura, arthritis, GI symptoms)."

What is the WHO classification and what is the pathogenesis?",
      "answer": "This is WHO Class IV lupus nephritis (diffuse proliferative GN), the most severe form. Pathogenesis involves immune complex deposition (DNA-anti-DNA antibodies) in subendothelial location, activating complement and causing inflammation.

Gleason grading: Pattern 4 (poorly formed glands, cribriform, fused) is the predominant pattern, Pattern 3 (well-formed separate glands) is secondary. Score 7 is intermediate grade. Gleason 4+3 has worse prognosis than 3+4 because predominant pattern matters. Loss of basal cell layer (p63/CK5/6 negative) distinguishes cancer from BPH.
